# Release Notes — v0.1.0

Release date: 2026-02-20

## Highlights

- Initial public CLI for IdeaMark v0.1.0
- Real parsing + strict validation (NDJSON diagnostics)
- Working/published formatting with canonical references
- Extract/compose/publish pipelines
- Comprehensive smoke and internal tests

## Commands

- `validate`: NDJSON diagnostics, strict/working modes
- `format`: stable formatting, optional `--canonical`
- `extract`: section/occurrence extraction with closure
- `compose`: union merge with conflict rename + reference retargeting
- `publish`: `format --canonical` + `validate --strict` with metadata updates
- `describe`: checklist/vocab/capabilities

## Behavioral Notes

- `publish` outputs no artifact on strict failure (diagnostics only, exit 1).
- `compose` resolves ID conflicts by UUID rename, keeps aliases, and retargets references.
- `format --canonical` normalizes all supported reference paths to `ideamark://docs/<doc_id>#/...`.
- `validate` emits NDJSON with `meta`, `diagnostic`, and `summary` records.

## Tests

- Smoke tests live under `docs/dev/v0.1.0/test-materials/v0.9.13/ideamark-tests-v0.9.13/`.
- `tests/run-smoke.js` verifies NDJSON via normalized comparison (subset + sorting).
- Internal tests cover strict validation, compose conflicts, extract closure, and publish failures.

## Known Limitations

- `--help` / `--version` flags are not implemented in the CLI yet.
- Relations are not followed by extract in v0.1.0.
